# Detector-19
expert system for diagnosis of possible infection by the COVID-19 virus

## Explanation

The expert system that I created implements the forward chaining method and the application of the Bayes theorem. Bayes theorem is used to determine the results of the diagnosis. Forward chaining method is used to collect scores from various questions given through the diagnosis process

Detector-19 is a simple "bot" to calculate a person's chance of being infected by the COVID-19 virus. This bot is named Hana. Hana can also calculate the possibility of someone being infected with the Alpha/Beta or Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus

The data used for the application of the Bayes theorem is the Indonesian population, the number of people who have been confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 virus, and the validity of the antigen swab test kit consisting of sensitivity and specificity. All questions used in the diagnosis process are obtained from various sources/research that has been carried out

The calculation results from the Bayes theorem will be used to calculate the probability of a person being infected by the COVID-19 virus by taking into account age, body temperature (Celsius), the number of vaccinations that have been carried out, and the disease experienced by the user.
